ðŸš€ Project: Deploying a Flask Web App Using Docker on AWS EC2
1. Project Summary
You built a simple web application using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, containerized it with Docker, and deployed it on an AWS EC2 instance. This project demonstrates full-cycle deployment from local development to cloud hosting using containerization â€” a key modern software engineering skill.

2. Tech Stack Overview
Technology	Role in Project	Real-World Use Case
Python	Programming language for backend (Flask app)	Widely used for backend services, automation, data science, and APIs in companies of all sizes
Flask	Web framework to build a simple HTTP server	Popular for building REST APIs and microservices in startups and enterprises
Docker	Containerization tool to package the app & deps	Ensures consistency across environments; used in CI/CD pipelines and microservice deployments
AWS EC2	Cloud VM to host and run your Docker container	Industry standard for scalable cloud infrastructure to host apps, databases, and services
Linux CLI	Command line tools for managing server & Docker	Essential skill for managing cloud infrastructure and DevOps workflows

3. Step-by-Step Workflow
Step 1: Build the Flask Application
Created a basic Flask app (app.py) that serves a simple message on root URL /.

Ensured the app listens on 0.0.0.0 so itâ€™s accessible from outside the container.

python
Copy
Edit
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "Hello from Flask on Docker!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000)
Step 2: Prepare Dependencies
Added requirements.txt listing Python dependencies (e.g., Flask) for Docker to install.

Step 3: Create Dockerfile
Wrote a Dockerfile to:

Use official Python slim image as base

Set working directory

Copy requirements.txt and install dependencies

Copy the Flask app files

Specify the command to run the Flask app inside the container

dockerfile
Copy
Edit
FROM python:3.11-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
Step 4: Build Docker Image Locally
Built the Docker image using:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker build -t flaskapp .
This packages your app and all dependencies into a container image.

Step 5: Deploy to AWS EC2
Provisioned an Ubuntu EC2 instance.

Installed Docker on EC2.

Copied your project files and Docker image to the EC2 instance.

Ran the Docker container on EC2, exposing Flaskâ€™s port 5000 mapped to host port 80.

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo docker run -d -p 80:5000 flaskapp
Step 6: Access the Flask App
Opened EC2â€™s public IP in a browser and saw the Flask app response.

4. Why This Workflow is Important in Real Companies
Environment Consistency: Docker ensures that your app runs exactly the same way on your laptop, on EC2, or in any cloud environment.

Simplifies Deployment: Using containers abstracts away OS differences and dependency hell.

Scalability: Running apps in containers is a step toward microservices architecture, where many small apps run independently but work together.

Cloud-Ready: AWS EC2 provides scalable, reliable infrastructure used by enterprises to deploy apps.

DevOps Culture: Understanding Docker and cloud VMs is crucial in companies following CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment).

5. Possible Extensions / Next Steps
Use Docker Compose to orchestrate multi-container apps (e.g., Flask + database).

Deploy using Kubernetes for automated scaling and management.

Add a CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, Jenkins) to automate builds and deployments.

Integrate an actual frontend (React, Angular) to build a full-stack app.

Add SSL and domain with AWS Route 53 and Load Balancer.

Use AWS ECS/EKS for production-grade container orchestration.

6. Summary
This project showcases your understanding of:

Python backend development with Flask

Dependency management

Containerization with Docker

Cloud deployment on AWS EC2

Linux command-line and server management

All these skills are highly sought after for roles like Backend Developer, DevOps Engineer, Cloud Engineer, and Full-Stack Developer.
